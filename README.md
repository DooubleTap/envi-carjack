# envi-carjack

Thank you for your support.

Envi-Carjack is a simple FiveM resource designed to allow the player to remove a player/NPC from the driver's seat of a vehicle that fully utilises the native GTA function and includes animations and synced window smash.
The player must be weilding the Nightstick Weapon. (You can add/ change weapons inside the config).

Compatible with qtarget, ox_target and can also be used without any taget system. 

Currently supports ESX but will convert to QB soon if there's enough interest!
